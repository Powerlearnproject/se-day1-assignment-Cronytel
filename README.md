Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a procedural way of developing and maintaining full-grade production-ready software systems, by means of usng engineering methods, principles and tools. The
procedures are what i would like to refer to as the PDTDM - product design, development, testing, deployment, and Maintenance )

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.
1970s: A number of new methodologies are developed, including structured programming and object-oriented programming.
1980s: The first computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are released.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, requirements, design and prototype, software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is ideal if your project has stable and clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change. This method ensures that all aspects of the project are well documented and
followed precisely. Agile should be considered when requirements are unclear or expected to evolve.
an example of the scenerio for agile is a Tech startup developing a mobile app, while an example for waterfall is Government software for public records

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer designs and builds computer programs that power mobile devices, desktop computers, and even cars.
What Software Quality Assurance Engineers and Testers Do. Design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures. Document software defects, using a bug tracking system,
and report defects to software developers. Identify, analyze, and document problems with program function, output, online screen, or content.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
One of the biggest values of an IDE for debugging purposes is that you can step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several
debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.
Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. Efficient branching and merging capabilities allow developers to work
concurrently on various aspects of a project without interference, significantly reducing the time from development to deployment.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing reqirements, debugging, technological changes, security etc. strategies to overcome these challenges is to stay updated, Adopt agile methodologies etc.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
User acceptance testing is the last step in the testing process and is done after the deployment of the software on the client side. Integration testing is done after the unit testing and functional testing are completed. For example, each part of a mobile undergoes unit testing to check if it is working properly

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data. Further, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
